# Pomodoro_Timer
A Pomodoro app to help with productivity and prevent burnout


This GUI application is designed to help productivity. The design was provided by a class from Udemy, as my projects focus primarily on the backend.
This productivity system uses a series of work timers and break timers to ensure you are able to stay on track while taking appropriate breaks.

Fun fact: "pomodoro" means "tomato" in Italian.
